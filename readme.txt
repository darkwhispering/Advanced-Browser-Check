Tell IE users to change browser? Or is your site for Chrome only? Now you can choose what browsers should trigger a warning popup or not on your site.

== Description ==

This plugin gives you the option to display a warning popup to your visitors if they use a browser that you don't support. For example, Internet Explorer 10 or lower.

It supports the 6 largest and most popular browser on the market.

* Firefox
* Chrome
* Safari
* Opera
* Internet Explorer
* Edge

You can customize the warning message, choose what browsers download pages you want to display a link to, select what browsers and browser versions that should trigger the popup and if the user can or can't hide the popup.

If you allow users to hide the popup, a cookie is set that expires after 24h. After 24h, the user will see the popup again with the option to hide it for another 24h.

This plugin is tested and works with the WP Super Cache and W3 Total Cache plugins. It is also tested and working on WordPress Networks.

Supported languages (Only English language are guaranteed to be up to date!)

*There is versions added of browsers that is not yet released as stable versions. This is to minimize the need of an plugin update in the future when new browsers are released and to let users try the plugin with beta and alpha version of the browsers. I will do my best to keep this plugin updated with the latest versions of available browsers.*

== Installation ==

1. Recommended is to install the plugin via your Wordpress Admin dashboard **OR** you can download the plugin here and upload the zipped file to /wp-content/plugins
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= I get "Parse error: syntax error, unexpected T_STRING, expecting T_CONSTANT_ENCAPSED_STRING..."  =

If you see a PHP error similar to this, that means you have a PHP version below 5.3. The plugin uses PHP Namespaces and PHP 5.3 is required as minimum. Please contact your hosting company and let then know you need PHP upgraded.

= I see a 404 error in the console =

For some users, that have a very secure setup of WordPress can get this issue if they block direct access to plugin files. See [this support thread](http://wordpress.org/support/topic/failed-to-load-resource-404-advanced-browser-checkphp) for information and direction of what might be the cause of your issue.

= There is nothing! No overlay, no popup =
The plugin requires that your theme have the wp_footer() function added. Without this, the plugin can't create the code it needs to place the overlay and popup on your site.

You also need to have wp_head() function added in your theme header for the script and stylesheet files.

= I only get a black overlay, no popup =
You can get this for many reasons. It can be any of the plugins you have installed that is not compatible with my plugin. It can also be your theme.

I test the plugin before every update on a clean WordPress installation with no other plugins activated or custom theme installed. Due to the large amount of 3rd party themes and plugins for Wordpress, it is impossible to guarantee that the plugin will work with them all.

Before posting a support thread, please try to inactivate all your plugins except Advanced Browser Check and try again. If you still have the issue, try with another theme, or install a clean WordPress is a subfolder so you can test the plugin on your server with a clean WordPress installation.

= I have selected not to block Chrome (or any other browser), but I still get the overlay =
Please read the above answer and perform the same tests before you start a new support thread. You should also turn on debugging so you see what browser the plugin detects.

= I have performed all test above, still not working =
Okay, might be time to start a support thread, but first, please see if someone else have had your issue and see if they might found a solution before you start a new thread.

If you create a new support post, please provide as much info as possible. Like what WordPress version you have, version of the plugin, browser you tested and versions on those browser. And of course, any error messages you see if you have that.
